    <h2>Multiple new things at once</h2>
    <p>
      I'm used to using `npm` and Create React App with React/JavaScript to set up the UI. I decided I'd
      use yarn instead, and vite, and switch to TypeScript. I've used yarn before, and I've used TS on the
      back end, so adding those two together was probably fine. But then I threw vite into the mix...
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I'm tempted to say "this was a bad idea" or at least "this made it harder", but are those things
      really true? After all, I figured it out, so it wasn't so difficult that I couldn't solve it. It was challenging because I'd run into a problem and I'd find an answer that expected one kind of context (e.g., npm) and I'd have to translate it to fit my context, but that sort of challenge actually seems healthy, given that the intent of this project is for me to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And maybe it took me longer to get set up with vite and yarn than it would have with CRA and npm, but then I'd be using CRA and npm. If I wanted to end up with vite and yarn, it would probably have taken me even longer.
