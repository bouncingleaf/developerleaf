    <h2>Thinking errors</h2>
    <p>
      Notes from a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sheril-mathews_common-thinking-errors-activity-7089957573222694912-tXb6">post</a> by <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/about/">Sheril Mathews</a>. Common thinking errors and how to spot them.
      First, the ones I suspect I fall into the most:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mind reading - "knowing" what others think, or assuming they know what you think. In my case, both.</li>
      <li>Jumping to conclusions - x therefore y with little evidence. This seems especially hazardous in combination with the previous -- x therefore y, with inadequate evidence provided by mind reading!</li>
      <li>Mental filtering - exclusive focus on negative (or positive), e.g. "that one thing I did wrong". Also works in combination with the others. Focus on the one negative thing that I think I mind read from someone else, and then jump to conclusions about it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, good to know oneself... Here are the others. Not saying I don't fall into these traps too... just that the ones above seem like my biggest hazards.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All or nothing thinking - perfect or total failure, always, never</li>
      <li>Fortune telling - usually negative, foregone conclusion, defeatism</li>
      <li>Overgeneralization - from one or two data points, e.g. Don Music "I'll never get it, never!"</li>
      <li>Should statements - unrealistic expectations</li>
      <li>Disqualifying positive - success is a fluke/unreliable, e.g. "they were just being polite"</li>
      <li>Magnification/Minimization - exaggerating or downplaying importance of something</li>
      <li>Catastrophizing - assuming the worst, mountains out of molehills</li>
      <li>Emotional reasoning - mistaking feelings for facts</li>
      <li>Personalization/Self-blame - it's my fault</li>
      <li>Labeling/Mislabeling - extreme overgeneralization</li>
      <li>Always/Never thinking - seems like overgeneralization + mind reading</li>
      <li>Entitlement - unrealistic expectations - see also Should</li>
      <li>Outsourcing happiness - I'll be happy when...</li>
      <li>Control fallacy - I control nothing (or everything)</li>
      <li>Low frustration tolerance - what it says on the box</li>
      <li>Fairness fallacy - life should always be fair and just - resentment, frustration</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Multiple new things at once</h2>
    <p>
      I'm used to using `npm` and Create React App with React/JavaScript to set up the UI. I decided I'd
      use yarn instead, and vite, and switch to TypeScript. I've used yarn before, and I've used TS on the
      back end, so adding those two together was probably fine. But then I threw vite into the mix...
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I'm tempted to say "this was a bad idea" or at least "this made it harder", but are those things
      really true? After all, I figured it out, so it wasn't so difficult that I couldn't solve it. It was challenging because I'd run into a problem and I'd find an answer that expected one kind of context (e.g., npm) and I'd have to translate it to fit my context, but that sort of challenge actually seems healthy, given that the intent of this project is for me to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And maybe it took me longer to get set up with vite and yarn than it would have with CRA and npm, but then I'd be using CRA and npm. If I wanted to end up with vite and yarn, it would probably have taken me even longer.
