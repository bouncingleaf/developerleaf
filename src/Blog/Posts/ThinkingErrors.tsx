      Notes from a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sheril-mathews_common-thinking-errors-activity-7089957573222694912-tXb6">post</a> by <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/about/">Sheril Mathews</a>. Common thinking errors and how to spot them.
      First, the ones I suspect I fall into the most:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mind reading - "knowing" what others think, or assuming they know what you think. In my case, both.</li>
      <li>Jumping to conclusions - x therefore y with little evidence. This seems especially hazardous in combination with the previous -- x therefore y, with inadequate evidence provided by mind reading!</li>
      <li>Mental filtering - exclusive focus on negative (or positive), e.g. "that one thing I did wrong". Also works in combination with the others. Focus on the one negative thing that I think I mind read from someone else, and then jump to conclusions about it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, good to know oneself... Here are the others. Not saying I don't fall into these traps too... just that the ones above seem like my biggest hazards.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All or nothing thinking - perfect or total failure, always, never</li>
      <li>Fortune telling - usually negative, foregone conclusion, defeatism</li>
      <li>Overgeneralization - from one or two data points, e.g. Don Music "I'll never get it, never!"</li>
      <li>Should statements - unrealistic expectations</li>
      <li>Disqualifying positive - success is a fluke/unreliable, e.g. "they were just being polite"</li>
      <li>Magnification/Minimization - exaggerating or downplaying importance of something</li>
      <li>Catastrophizing - assuming the worst, mountains out of molehills</li>
      <li>Emotional reasoning - mistaking feelings for facts</li>
      <li>Personalization/Self-blame - it's my fault</li>
      <li>Labeling/Mislabeling - extreme overgeneralization</li>
      <li>Always/Never thinking - seems like overgeneralization + mind reading</li>
      <li>Entitlement - unrealistic expectations - see also Should</li>
      <li>Outsourcing happiness - I'll be happy when...</li>
      <li>Control fallacy - I control nothing (or everything)</li>
      <li>Low frustration tolerance - what it says on the box</li>
      <li>Fairness fallacy - life should always be fair and just - resentment, frustration</li>

    </ul>
